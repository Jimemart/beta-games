<h1> BETA </h1>

<p> Beta is an app created for gamers by gamers. It is a platform that allows gamers around the world to find people with 
their same interests in games and platforms. The app is part of Ironhack's Web Development Bootcamp final project and therefore
it was developed in under two weeks. The technologies used to develop it were: Angular 4, Mongo DB, Express and Node.</p>

<p> This app was made in collaboration with UX designer Inés Valcárcel</p>
